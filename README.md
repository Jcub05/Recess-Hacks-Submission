# Recess-Hacks-Submission
Submission for the Recess Hacks 2021 Hackathon

My name is Jacob currently in grade 12, taken grade 11 and 12 compsci. I have been programming for a couple of years now on and off. My main programming language is Java but I've also done things with python as well. I'm not working on anything right now but my last project was a java app that turned image files into ASCII art.
